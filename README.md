Target framework: .NET Framework 4.6.1

Because of the lockdown caused by COVID-19 outbreak, the labs at the university were also closed, where the industrial sensor measurements were carried out. To overcome this challenge, I began to work on a set of .NET framework based application, which are intended to model the behavior of the real measurement setup. The output values are generated using real measurement data with random noise generation. Each interface has an image about the measurement setup, which illustrates the physical arrangement of the devices.
