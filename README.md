Target framework: .NET Framework 4.6.1

Because of the lockdown caused by COVID-19 outbreak, the labs at the university were also closed, where the industrial sensor measurements were carried out. To overcome this challenge, I began to work on a set of .NET framework based application, which are intended to model the behavior of the real measurement setup. The output values are generated using real measurement data with random noise generation. Each interface has an image about the measurement setup, which illustrates the physical arrangement of the devices.

Model descriptions

Data Acqusition System model: is based on a data acquisition system connected to a PC. This collects data from 3 different inputs: strain gauge interface, 10x divider input and 2x multiplier input. The divider and multiplier modules receive the same amplitude sine wave, hence their different behavior can be observed. The strain gauge interface receives the input voltage from strain gauges mounted on a steel plate, which is loaded by masses. By changing the number of masses on the steel plate, the measured output voltage of the strain gauges changes accordingly.
