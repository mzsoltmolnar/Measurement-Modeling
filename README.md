## Goal of the project

Because of the lockdown caused by COVID-19 outbreak, the labs at the university were closed, where the industrial sensor measurements were carried out. To overcome this challenge, I began to work on a set of .NET framework-based applications, which are intended to model the behavior of the real measurement setup. The output values are generated using actual measurement data with random noise generation. Each interface has an image of the measurement setup, which illustrates the physical arrangement of the devices.
