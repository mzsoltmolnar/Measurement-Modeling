### Inductive Sensor.exe - Induvtive sensor measurement modeling
During the inductive sensor measurement, the supply voltage-sensing distance correlation is examined using steel and aluminum targets.

### Solar Module.exe - Solar module measurement modeling
By changing the load resistor values connected to the solar module, the module's peak power can be determined for a constant illumination. In this way, the optimal load resistance can be determined.

### Optical Sensor.exe - Optical sensor measurement modeling
During the optical sensor measurement, the change in sensing distance is modeled using different material targets. For the retroreflective sensor, the sensing stability for different targets is modeled.

### Pressure Transducer.exe - Pressure transducer measurement modeling
The pressure transducer measurement models the behavior of a piezoresistive transducer connected in a measurement loop. The pressure can be increased and decreased using a syringe.

### Capacitive Sensor.exe - Capacitive sensor measurement modeling
During capacitive sensor measurement, the sensing distance of a capacitive sensor is examined for different material targets (metals and non-metals).

### Temperature Measurement.exe - Temperature sensor measurement modeling
The temperature measurement models the behavior of three different temperature sensors (thermocouple, thermistor, and PT-100) outputs as the measured temperature increases.

### Ultrasonic Sensor.exe - Ultrasonic sensor measurement modeling
During the ultrasonic sensor measurement, the sensing range change of the sensor for different target material is determined.

### Strain Gauge.exe - Strain gauge measurement modeling
Using strain gauges mounted on a steel plate by applying force on the plate's one end, different characteristics of the strain gauges can be determined.

### Data Acquisition System.exe - Data acquisition system measurement modeling
The strain gauge input and data output of a data acquisition system is modeled. Three different channels can be selected. One channel displays the output values of a strain gauge system. The elongations of the strain gauges can be modified by placing a different number of weights on the steel plate. The DAQ system has two other channels, which receive the input voltage from the same signal source. One channel has a 10x divider, and the other a 2x multiplier input. The goal is to determine if the measured values satisfy the criteria that they are connected to the same signal source.
